# pizza-menu
my first attempt for python2

This is a python2 program that is meant to be a pizza restaurant menu
it should have 5 different types of pizza
a price for each pizza
and a list of the ingredients

I feel like I have done a really long hand version of it and would love help to write something shorter.
